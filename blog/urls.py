"""
As you can see, we're now assigning a view called post_list to the ^$ URL. This regular expression will match ^ (a beginning) followed by $ (an end) â€“ so only an empty string will match. That's correct, because in Django URL resolvers, 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/' is not a part of the URL. This pattern will tell Django that views.post_list is the right place to go if someone enters your website at the 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/' address.
